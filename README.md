# Hammond Project on Simple Random Bridges

## Formatting of the file

The main class for Simple Random Bridges (SRBs) is stored in Bridge.py, and the file for working on a general graph/simulation is __main__.py. If you just run this folder in python, this will be the file that automatically runs. Other grpahs/simulations that have already been finished are stored in the other named files. For example, 100plots.py is the file that makes a 10x10 square of graphs before and after repeated addition.

## How the Bridge class works

The Bridge class taken in two paramaters, the number of points in the SRB (size) and the specific heights of each point (body). If you do not input a specific body, then it will be generated randomly.

Details on all of the methods in the Bridge class, what they do, and how they work, is explained relatively clearly in the Bridge.py file its self.

## LaTeX Write up

In a seperate file a LaTeX write up of the current progress on the project. It includes definitions, proofs, and abundant graphs
